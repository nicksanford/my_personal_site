Hi, I'm Nick Sanford. I'm a software developer with over 6 years professional
experience building everything from web to embedded applications in languages
such as Elixir, Erlang, Python, Ruby, and Javascript.

I love learning new (to me) languages and ways of thinking about programming.

Some topics I'm most interested in now include Rust, SAT solvers & other OR
approaches, sandboxed runtimes, and programming environments that empower people
who don't think of themselves as programmers to be able to program.
