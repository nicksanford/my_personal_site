my last post I have been climbing what I recently heard \nJulie Moronuki call the \nHaskell Pyramid. I have been learning\nabout the bread and butter abstractions which Haskell programmers use all the time\nand serve as useful tools to describe and compose  programs. These are not only \nrequired knowledge to be able to use most of the really cool\nHaskell features that excite me (which I will cover in a later post) but also\nuseful ways to model computation in general, even if one is not using\nHaskell.\nI have been learning about SemiGroups, Monoids, Functors, Applicatives, Monads, Foldables, \nTraversables and Reader from the Haskell Book, which\nJulie co-authored. I figured that now would be a good time to take stock of what\nI have learned. This is meant to be a fly by of these topics, more of a cheatsheet\nthan a tour.  If you want to learn more about these topics, I recommend checking\nout Haskell Book. All the exercises I worked through \nto gain an intuition about these abstractions can be found \nhere\nSemiGroup, Monoid, Functor, Applicative, and Monad are abstractions,\nwhich have laws, which concrete implementations must conform to in order to be \na valid instances of that abstraction. While learning about these abstractions, \nI used  QuickCheck, a property \nbased testing library, to verify that the instances I wrote conformed\nto the appropriate laws.  I found this to be an extremely effective way to learn\nnew concepts because my test suite was able to serve as a constant feedback loop.\nSemiGroup\nAs described on the Hackage SemiGroup package, a SemiGroup is an algebraic structure, consisting of a set together with an associative, binary operation (&lt;&gt;).\nthe \nI know this function &lt;&gt; is called mappend if on Monoid, but I don't know \nwhat it is called on SemiGroup.\nIn order for something to be a valid SemiGroup it's &lt;&gt; function must be binary\n(take two arguments) and associative:\na &lt;&gt; (b &lt;&gt; c) == (a &lt;&gt; b) &lt;&gt; c\n\nSome things that exhibit SemiGroup behavior include non empty lists, and getting\nthe first and last elements from a sequence of (&lt;&gt;) calls:\nFirst 1 &lt;&gt; First 2 &lt;&gt; First 3\n=&gt; First 1\nLast 1 &lt;&gt; Last 2 &lt;&gt; Last 3\n=&gt; Last 3\nMonoid\nMonoids are a SemiGroup that has an identity value (described by mempty) such that:\nmempty &lt;&gt; x == x\nx &lt;&gt; mempty == x\n\nAll Monoids also have the binary associative function &lt;&gt; which can be inherited\nfrom their SemiGroup instance, and is called mappend (i.e. &lt;&gt; == mappend if it is\nbeing applied to a Monoid).\nNumbers (both over multiplication and addition) boolean conjunction (and) \ndisjunction (or), (a &amp;&amp; b &amp;&amp; c) and (a || b || c) patterns, list concatenation\nand zipping all exhibit Monoidal behavior (i.e. they have an identity value and \na binary associative operation).\nLucy Zhang also showed me that Groups (which\nI came across when researching Kademlia,\nthe DHT protocol used \nin BitTorrent and IPFS) are Monoids that have an inverse for every value. An \nexample of groups would be integers over addition, where zero is it's own \ninverse, and negative numbers and positive numbers are inverses of each other.\nMonoids have kind *.\nFunctor\nFunctors have some structure that is not able to be altered, but which can allow \nfor transformations on values that are not part of the structure.\nList, Maybe, Either, Tuples, and functions are all functors.\nThey implement fmap, which can also be written as &lt;$&gt;.\nfmap :: Functor f =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b\n\nand have the following laws which they must obey to preserve\ntheir structure:\nidentity\nfmap id == id\ncomposition\nfmap (f . g) == fmap f . fmap g\n\nIf you try to change the structure of a functor it will violate the composition \nlaw, as applying fmap multiple times will yield a different result, than just \napplying it once and composing two functions.\nFunctors must have kind * -&gt; * as they must have a type inhabitant which is not\npart of the structure, such as the Right values in the case of Either, or \nlist elements in the case of Lists .\nLists, functions, and IO are all examples of functors. Function composition, ., is fmap on functions:\n(.) :: (b -&gt; c) -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; (a -&gt; c)\n\nwhere f is (-&gt; a).\nSomething I found profoundly beautiful is when one applies fmap to itself (as\nin the example below)\n(fmap . fmap) show [Just 1, Just 3, Nothing] \n=&gt; [Just \"1\", Just \"3\", Nothing]\n\nthe way the types work out requires algebraic substitution of the types:\n(.) :: (b -&gt; c) -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; (a -&gt; c)\nfmap1 :: Functor f =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b\nfmap2 :: Functor g =&gt; (c -&gt; d) -&gt; g c -&gt; g d\n\nIn fmap . fmap the type signature expands out to \n((a -&gt; b) -&gt; (f a -&gt; f b)) -&gt; ((c -&gt; d) -&gt; (g c -&gt; g d))\n\nBecause we know that the b in compose \n(b -&gt; c) -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; (a -&gt; c)\n\nis the same as: \n(a -&gt; b)\n\nin the first fmap, and\n(g c -&gt; g d)\n\nin the second fmap\nwe know that f a from the first fmap can be rewritten as f (g c) and \nf b from the second can be rewritten as f (g d),\nwhich means we can rewrite our type signature for fmap . fmap as\n(c -&gt; d) -&gt; (f (g c) -&gt; f (g d))\n\nwhich describes at the type level transforming a value within a functor, within a functor.\nIt absolutely blew my mind that you could work that out from the types alone without\nneeding to think about what is happening at the value level at all.\nOn Maybe or Either, Nothing and Left values are ignored by fmap because they are\npart of the structure, which must be left intact in order to comply with the functor\nlaws.\nFunctor (unlike Monoid) only has a single valid instance for a given type.\nFunctors are very useful for transforming values inside of IO. I used\nthis repeatedly in my QuickCheck testing to transform lists generated by QuickCheck\ninto other data-structures which I needed for testing.\nApplicative\nAs described in the Haskell Book: \n\"Applicatives are monoidal functors:\n\nMonoids give us a way to mash data-structures together. \nFunctors give us a way do do function application in a structure.\nApplicatives give us away to apply functions which are themselves in a structure over another structure and then mash the structures together.\"\n\nApplicatives have 2 operations:\npure :: Applicative f =&gt; a -&gt; f a\n\nwhich takes a value of any type and puts it into an applicative context\n(&lt;*&gt;) :: Applicative f =&gt; f (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b\n\nwhich applies a function in an applicative structure to values in an applicative \nstructure, and combines the two applicative structures.\nThey must together follow the following laws:\nIdentity\npure id &lt;*&gt; v = v\nComposition\npure (.) &lt;*&gt; u &lt;*&gt; v &lt;*&gt; w = u &lt;*&gt; (v &lt;*&gt; w)\nHomomorphism\npure f &lt;*&gt; pure x = pure (f x)\nInterchange\nu &lt;*&gt; pure y = pure ($ y) &lt;*&gt; u\n\nIf we compare, $ (which is just function application), &lt;$&gt; (fmap) and &lt;*&gt;\n$   ::(a -&gt; b) -&gt;   a -&gt;   b\n&lt;$&gt; ::(a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b\n&lt;*&gt; ::(a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b\n\nwe see that fmap is jut function application over a functor, and applicative\napplication is just functorial application, where the function is within a \nstructure, which implies that the structures must be combined in some way.\n&lt;*&gt; lets us do function application on functions in a structure like so:\nJust (*2) &lt;*&gt; Just 3\n=&gt; Just 6\n\nNothing &lt;*&gt; Just 3\n=&gt; Nothing\n\nWrapping a function in pure and applying &lt;*&gt; is the same as just fmapping using\nthe function.\npure f &lt;*&gt; y == f &lt;$&gt; y\n\nApplicatives have their structure combined using a monoidal pattern, however\nbecause there are multiple possible monoidal patterns on many types, there is no\nguarantee the applicative will use any specific Monoid instance for that type. \nAlso, there is no typeclass constraint on Applicatives that they must be Monoids.\nThe function application component will be the same as fmap though, as there\nis only one valid functorial instance for a given type.\nMonad\nAs Nick Collins explained during our \nHaskell Study group, Monad's bind (&gt;&gt;=) is nothing more than flatMap.\nDefinition:\nclass Applicative m =&gt; Monad m where\n(&gt;&gt;=) :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b\n(&gt;&gt;) :: m a -&gt; m b -&gt; m b\nreturn :: a -&gt; m a\n\nI also learned about the fish operator:\n(&gt;=&gt;) Monad m -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; (b -&gt; m c) -&gt; a -&gt; m c\n\nI don't have much to say about monads other than if you just treat them like\nthings which support flatMap (whereby you are able to flatten out structures \ngenerated from calling bind, while adding new resulting values to the new structure) I find that they \nbecome a lot easier to work with and reason about.\nFoldable:\nFoldable (which is a typeclass which allows your \ndata-structure to be folded over), requires only either\nfoldr or  or foldMap to be defined. If you define foldMap\nyou need for the type to also have a Monoid instance so you are able to use\nmappend / mconcat to summarize the Monoid structures you are folding over.\nBy defining a foldable instance for your type, you are also able to get a number\nof convenience functions which can be written using folding functions inferred automatically including:\nfoldl' :: (b -&gt; a -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; t a -&gt; b\ntoList :: t a -&gt; [a]\nnull :: t a -&gt; Bool\nlength :: t a -&gt; Int\nelem :: Eq a =&gt; a -&gt; t a -&gt; Bool \nmaximum :: forall a. Ord a =&gt; t a -&gt; a \nminimum :: forall a. Ord a =&gt; t a -&gt; a \nsum :: Num a =&gt; t a -&gt; a \nproduct :: Num a =&gt; t a -&gt; a \n\nWhile learning about Foldable with Santiago Gepigon\nduring the Haskell Study Group, we also learned about the ScopedTypeVariables \nlanguage extension and how it is needed to define type signatures for\npolymorphic functions defined in where clauses.\nTraversable:\nAs described in the book:\n\"Traversable allows you to transform elements in a structure (like functor) \nwhile producing applicative effects along the way, and lift the (potentially \nmultiple) applicative effects outside of the traversable structure.\"\nHas 2 functions:\nsequenceA :: (Traversable t, Applicative f) =&gt; t (f a) -&gt; f (t a)\ntraverse :: (Traversable t, Applicative f) =&gt; (a -&gt; f b) -&gt; t a -&gt; f (t b)\n\nHere are some examples of how they work:\nsequenceA  [Just 1, Just 2, Just 3] \n=&gt; Just [1,2,3]\nsequenceA  [Just 1, Just 2, Nothing]\n=&gt; Nothing\nsequenceA :: (Traversable t, Applicative f)\n=&gt; -&gt; t (f a) -&gt; f (t a)\ntraverse :: (Traversable t, Applicative f)\n=&gt; (a -&gt; f a) -&gt; t a -&gt; f (t a)\n\ntraverse must follow the following laws:\nNaturality\nt . traverse f = traverse (t . f)\nIdentity\ntraverse Identity = Identity\nComposition\ntraverse (Compose . fmap g . f) = Compose . fmap (traverse g) . traverse f\n\nsequenceA must follow the following laws:\nNaturality\nt . sequenceA = sequenceA . fmap t\nIdentity\nsequenceA . fmap Identity = Identity\nComposition\nsequenceA . fmap Compose = Compose . fmap sequenceA . sequenceA\n\nTraverse is really useful when you have a traversable and you need to transform\nit into an applicative of a traversable, while converting each element to an \napplicative and applying &lt;*&gt; to the intermediate values.\nReader\nAs mentioned above, functions ((-&gt;) r) are functors and (.) == fmap. The r is part of the functoral\nstructure, and therefor the only thing that can change with fmap application is\nthe return value of the function. \n(Reader r a) is just a wrapper around  function composition.\nThe r from Reader here is part of the f structure, so it gets applied with the first argument:\npure :: a -&gt; f a\npure :: a  -&gt; (r -&gt; a)\n\n(&lt;*&gt;) :: f (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b\n(&lt;*&gt;) :: (r -&gt; a -&gt; b) -&gt; (r -&gt; a) -&gt; (r -&gt; b)\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/2018-08-06-haskell-pyramid/","title":"haskell pyramid"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/elm-is-awesome/":{"body":"I have spent about two days total since my previous\npost completing pragmatic studio's intro to\nelm course and getting about half way\nthrough the second signals, mailboxes, and ports elm\ncourse.  Working through these\ncourses has reminded me why I fell in love with Haskell when I first started\nlearning it over a year ago.\nFirst off: the courses are absolutely fantastic.  I tore through them in about\na weekend and feel like I have been exposed to enough Elm to know what\nquestions to ask when I actually start building an Elm app.  By the time I am\ncompletely done with the second course I expect I will have more than enough\nknowledge to get started building an Elm app that has a JS dependency, which I\nwill need for my half baked silly project idea I alluded to in the previous\npost.\nElm has reinvigorated my passion and curiosity in ML style functional\nprograming.  The Elm courses I worked through recommend declaring function\ntype signatures before implementing function itself.  I love this development\nworkflow because it means you have to think about how your functions will\ncompose on a type level before you write them, which frequently leads you down\na design path where composing the values becomes trivial.\nFurthermore, working with a good compiler that keeps me honest is something I\nnow realize I need dearly.  It is just so damn comforting to know that the\ncompiler is checking my assumptions even when I am not aware I am making them.\nI am now aware that when I write Ruby or JS I have to constantly second guess\nmyself about whether I am shooting myself in the foot.\nI now wish that I knew Haskell well enough to make use of it's amazing\ncompiler and actually use it to get shit done.  Elm offers a really nice\nmiddle ground because I feel that I could quickly become as productive in it as\nI am in React and develop habits that will make me more productive in Haskell\nwhen I start learning it again for the third time.\nAlso many concepts that seemed so abstract to me when I was first learning\nHaskell seem much more within reach. Things such as how to use Maybe or Either\nare much more intuitive now that I have seen pattern matching on Elixir tuples \nto handle a very similar concern.  The Elixir pattern of using tuples to\nrepresent computations that may succeed or fail like so:\ncase HttPoison.get(url) do\n  {:ok, value} -&gt;\n    #something with value\n  {:err, err} -&gt;\n    #something with value\nend\n\nis very similar to Haskell or Elm's way of using Either values such as:\ncase String.parseInt intString of\n  Ok value -&gt;\n  --something with value\n  Err error -&gt;\n  --something with error\n\nElm has also make me aware of how I wish I could write React apps. The React\napps I have worked on so far are littered with state.  This greatly reduces the\nteam's ability to compose and reuse components.  Furthermore, the components\nare also littered with domain logic, which makes refactoring and modification \ndifficult.  I look forward to building Elm apps that are as stateless as\npossible and isolate domain logic where it can't bleed into more general\nconcerns.\nAlso, Signals are such a better way of dealing with user input than the event\nhandlers we use in React.  Modeling user input as a stream of data (which is \nwhat I understand Signals to be at this moment) allows you to compose them in\na way I can only dream of doing in the React apps I have been involved with so\nfar.\nIn any case I am definitely going to use Elm as my dynamic web front-end of\nchoice in my next silly side project.  I will finish the course on signals\nand then probably take a bit of a break to complete a silly side project\nprototype which will be the topic of a future post.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/elm-is-awesome/","title":"elm is awesome"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/first-go-at-elm/":{"body":"As mentioned in my previous post, this\nblog documents the silly side projects that I do for fun and education.
